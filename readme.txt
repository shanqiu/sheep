Title:
Come here! Little Sheep!

Description:
The sheep is kind of stupid but funny. No matter who clicks the canvas, he will run towards the mouse click position immediately. We want to create an user experience like the user is competing with other users to draw little sheep's attention. 

"finalWork"folder includes our final work without the music, "finalWorkWithMusic" folder includes the version with music. Since the music version only works on firefox browser, incase it may look like the code not working, we put two versions in the zip file.

It was a brand new idea, not related to the homeworks in past two weeks. We faced some difficulty in evolving the past works into a networked art. Therefore, we decided to come up with a simple but funny idea. Websocket was kind of a difficult concept to us, we chose to emit "MouseX" and "MouseY" parameters so that we had an example "ant with friends" to study in. We actually thought it might be more interesting to have all users collaborate together to herd sheep. But we did not work it out. However, we are glad that we successfully gave the sheep some motion blur effect by coding!


Work Breakdown:
We collaborated on the coding, including the vector, drawing, and socket part. There was no specific task for each one. Basically, we all worked on the research, coding, and debugging. When some one faced some difficulty in coding, the other two would do the research and help on debugging.
